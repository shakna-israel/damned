## Frequently Asked Questions

### What!?

Well, it's been done before. Like [Shell Curses](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-shellcurses/index.html), implemented in ksh.

Partly, I've made this because I can.

Partly because I now know far more about ANSI escapes than I want.

Partly to show that every CLI-manipulation question doesn't need to be answered with 'use curses'.

### Does it implement curses API?

No. I don't feel like gouging my eyes out when writing my own documentation.

That and that Object-Oriented isn't a good fit for shell.

### Hey! This doesn't behave the same way curses does!

No. Because curses feels the need to do things that aren't actually necessary, like clearing the console when creating a new window.

You may want to, but you may manage your program another way. Why should the API get in the way of that?

### Will you implement a feature for me?

*shrug*. Maybe.

If you ask nicely. (Or pay me. Either is accepted.)

And if I have the time.

And if I can find a way too.

### Why won't you accept my pull request?

I'm sorry. I really want to.

Unfortunately, somebody decided copyright needed to be incredibly complicated.

So, when I turned around and decided that ```damned``` should be Public Domain, I found I *can't* even make my own work Public Domain.

I can use the Creative Commons 0 License, which I have, but that would mean everyone who contributes would have to do the same... And I can't assess whether or not that is actually legally binding in any way.

Please, *please*, go yell at your government about it. Mine too.

### I find your tone impolite.

I have found that my background and culture rubs American and Asian folks up the wrong way. I'm sorry, I'm an Australian. I lived in a place that used 'C U in the NT' as their international tourism slogan.
